Objectives
Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
Develop functions to create reusable code.
Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

Instructions
Create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as described by a specification. 
Use the sample data within this sandbox to begin your program, and test against the given result.
Afterwards, alter the data to test for edge cases, error handling, and other potential issues.
